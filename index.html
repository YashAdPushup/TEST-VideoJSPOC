      The India men's national cricket team', also known as akskss[10] and Men
      in Blue,[11] represents India in men's International Cricket. It is
      governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a
      Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day
      International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status. Cricket was
      introduced to India by British sailors in the 18th century, and the first
      cricket club was established in 1792. India's national cricket team did
      not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the
      sixth team to be granted test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait
      until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty
      years of international cricket, India didn't gain much success, winning
      only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained
      strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players like Gavaskar,
      Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet. Traditionally much
      stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas
      form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since the start of the 21st
      century, winning Test matches in Australia, England and South Africa. It
      was the second cricket team to win the World Cup after West Indies. It has
      won the Cricket World Cup twice – in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev
      and in 2011 under the captaincy of MS Dhoni. After winning the 2011 World
      Cup, India became only the third team after West Indies and Australia to
      have won the World Cup more than once,[12] and the first cricket team to
      win the World Cup at home.[13][14] It also won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20
      and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, under the captaincy of MS Dhoni. It was
      also the joint champions of 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, along with Sri
      Lanka. The team has also won the World Championship of Cricket in 1985
      defeating Pakistan in the final. They have also won ACC Asia Cup seven
      times, making them one of the most successful cricket teams in both Asia
      and the World. They are also one of the only four teams to win all major
      ICC tournaments. India have also won the ICC Test Championship 5 times
      making them the second team to win most ICC Test Mace after Australia.
      They have also won the ICC ODI Championship, and the ICC T20I
      Championship. The Indian cricket team has rivalries with other
      Test-playing nations, most notably with Pakistan, the political arch-rival
      of India and with Australia. However, in recent times, rivalries with
      South Africa and England have also gained prominence. As of 6 December
      2021, India are ranked first in Tests, fourth in ODIs and second in T20Is
      by the ICC.[15] Virat Kohli is the current captain of the team in Tests,
      while Rohit Sharma is the current captain of the team in ODIs and
      T20Is;[16] the head coach is Rahul Dravid.[17]
